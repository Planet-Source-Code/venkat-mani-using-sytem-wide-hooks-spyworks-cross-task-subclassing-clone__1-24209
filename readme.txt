IMP -rename keylbuster.dl_ to keybuster.dll


Just click on the button below a new notepad window will open.I have added a sub menu to the edit menu .Click on it and u will see a messagebox  and text being added to the notepad .This has been done by using a combination of system wide hooks and vb.The dll has been made in c++.The dll has been made in c++ simply because of the limitations in making a dll in vb.The dll takes care of the click event.Just rename the .dl_ file as .dll.Keep the dll in the same directory as this vb project.If u want to have a look at the c++ source of the dll send me a mail at venky_dude@yahoo.com. Questions,commenst send them to venky_dude@yahoo.com .
